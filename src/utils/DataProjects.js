      "This project was a fun way to use the Poke API to build an app in React. Using the API, we created a pokedex app like the device that Ash Ketchum uses in the show. We used skeumorphism to style the app to really make you feel like you are using a physical pokedex. Using skeuomorphism and bringing music from the game into the app, makes it really fun to use this app.",

      "This app was the first app I got to work on with a team coming out of the react class into my react apprenticeship. Using the IMDB API, we built an app that gives you the ability to look up any movie you'd like, and get information on it. You can see run times, casts, and release dates. Some of the challenges we had making this app was integrating pagination into the app.",

      "Building this app was a fun challenge I started for myself. I wanted to challenge myself to build something in React that would test my abilities to follow a strict design, and functionality. I also used redux to manage the many states that need to be handled throughout the app. In this clone, you can also create a log in, through Firebase authenthication.",

We used expo to use the phone emulator while we built the app. We created a collection of mini games that use the phone's sensors as the controller.",
